2014-02-19 index1 must be less than index2. Note that num[index1] may be larger than num[index2]

* [Linked List Cycle ](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)  
2014-03-03 I only come up with a O(n) space solution which would accept in . I learn "fast and slow runner" method from forum which only cost O(1) space.

* [Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)  
2014-03-03 use std::set to accumulate values.

* [Merge Two Sorted Lists](http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)  
2014-03-07 straight forward solution.
